# Libft - 42Porto Common Core

## Introduction

**Libft** is a foundational project at 42Porto, part of the Common Core curriculum. The goal of this project is to reimplement a selection of functions from the standard C library (stdlib). By doing so, students gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of these essential functions and develop their own custom library that can be used in future projects at 42.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will implement various functions from the C library, such as string manipulation, memory management, linked lists, and more. This is not only a technical challenge but also an exercise in writing clean, efficient, and reusable code. The custom library you create will serve as a toolbox for solving more complex problems in subsequent projects.

### Key Learning Outcomes

- **Deepen C Programming Knowledge**: By reimplementing standard library functions, you'll strengthen your understanding of pointers, memory allocation, and string manipulation in C.
- **Build a Strong Foundation**: The functions you write in this project will be foundational for many other projects at 42. You'll be using your `libft` library to support more advanced projects, so it's crucial to ensure its reliability and efficiency.
- **Code Quality and Reusability**: This project emphasizes writing code that is not only functional but also well-organized and easy to reuse. Proper documentation, code comments, and modular design are key aspects of this learning process.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several categories of functions:

- **Memory**: Functions for memory allocation, freeing, and manipulation (`malloc`, `free`, `memcpy`, etc.).
- **String Handling**: Functions for working with C strings (`strcpy`, `strlen`, `strdup`, etc.).
- **Linked Lists**: Basic implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists.
- **Additional Functions**: Any other utility functions that might be useful across different projects.

## Importance for Future Projects

Libft serves as a critical stepping stone in your 42 journey. The skills and code you develop here will directly impact your performance in future projects, where you'll need to rely on a robust and optimized codebase. Moreover, this project encourages a disciplined approach to coding, with a focus on writing code that is both readable and maintainableâ€”a skill that is invaluable in professional software development.

## Conclusion

Libft is more than just a simple coding exercise; it's a crucial project that lays the groundwork for your success in the 42 curriculum. By mastering the concepts and techniques in Libft, you'll be well-prepared to tackle more advanced challenges and build complex software solutions.
